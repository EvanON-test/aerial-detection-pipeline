"""
Tracking module for multi-object tracking.

This module implements multi-object tracking algorithms to maintain object
identity across video frames. It associates detections with existing tracks,
manages track lifecycles, and provides trajectory analysis.

Planned Components:
- **SORT Tracker**: Simple Online and Realtime Tracking implementation
- **DeepSORT**: Enhanced tracking with appearance features
- **Kalman Filter**: Motion prediction and state estimation
- **Hungarian Algorithm**: Optimal detection-to-track assignment
- **Track Management**: Track creation, update, and deletion
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Motion patterns and behavior analysis

Key Features:
- Real-time multi-object tracking
- Robust handling of occlusions and missed detections
- Configurable tracking parameters (age, hits, IoU thresholds)
- Motion prediction using Kalman filters
- Appearance-based re-identification (DeepSORT)
- Track quality assessment and filtering

The tracking system workflow:
1. Receive detections from the detection module
2. Predict track positions using motion models
3. Associate detections with existing tracks
4. Update track states with new detections
5. Create new tracks for unmatched detections
6. Remove old or low-quality tracks
7. Provide updated track list with trajectories

Tracking States:
- **TENTATIVE**: New track requiring confirmation
- **CONFIRMED**: Stable track with sufficient history
- **DELETED**: Track marked for removal

Usage (planned):
    from src.tracking import SORTTracker
    
    tracker = SORTTracker(max_age=30, min_hits=3)
    tracked_objects = tracker.update(detections)

Note: This module is currently under development. Track management
functionality will be implemented based on the interfaces defined
in src.models.interfaces.TrackerInterface.
