"""
Detection module for aerial object detection.

This module contains the object detection components responsible for identifying
aerial objects in camera frames using AI models. It provides implementations
for various model formats and inference backends.

Planned Components:
- **ONNX Inference Engine**: Optimized ONNX Runtime inference
- **PyTorch Model Support**: Native PyTorch model inference
- **TensorRT Optimization**: GPU-accelerated inference (where available)
- **Model Management**: Loading, switching, and optimization
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Frame preparation and augmentation
- **Postprocessing**: NMS, filtering, and result formatting

Key Features:
- Multi-format model support (ONNX, PyTorch, TensorRT)
- Hardware-specific optimizations (CPU, GPU, edge devices)
- Configurable inference parameters
- Performance monitoring and profiling
- Automatic model fallback mechanisms
- Batch processing capabilities

The detection system is designed to:
1. Load and optimize AI models for the target hardware
2. Preprocess camera frames for model input
3. Run inference to detect aerial objects
4. Postprocess results to filter and format detections
5. Provide performance metrics and monitoring

Usage (planned):
    from src.detection import ONNXInferenceEngine
    
    engine = ONNXInferenceEngine("models/yolov8n.onnx")
    detections = engine.infer(frame)

Note: This module is currently under development. The inference functionality
is currently implemented in src/test_infer_onnx.py for testing purposes.
