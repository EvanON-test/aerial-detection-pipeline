"""
Test package for the aerial detection system.

This package contains comprehensive tests for all system components including
unit tests, integration tests, and performance benchmarks. The tests ensure
system reliability, validate functionality, and catch regressions during
development.

Test Categories:
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction and data flow
- **Configuration Tests**: Configuration management and validation
- **Model Tests**: Data model validation and behavior
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmarking and optimization validation
- **Hardware Tests**: Platform-specific functionality

Test Structure:
- test_config_manager.py: Configuration system tests
- test_data_models.py: Data model validation tests
- test_interfaces.py: Interface contract validation (planned)
- test_detection.py: Detection module tests (planned)
- test_tracking.py: Tracking system tests (planned)
- test_integration.py: End-to-end system tests (planned)

Testing Framework:
- pytest: Primary testing framework
- pytest-cov: Code coverage analysis
- pytest-benchmark: Performance benchmarking
- pytest-mock: Mocking and fixtures

Running Tests:
    # Run all tests
    pytest tests/ -v
    
    # Run specific test file
    pytest tests/test_config_manager.py -v
    
    # Run with coverage
    pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html
    
    # Run performance benchmarks
    pytest tests/ --benchmark-only

Test Guidelines:
- Each test should be independent and isolated
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use realistic test data that matches actual usage
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

Note: Some test modules are planned for future development as
corresponding system components are implemented.
